      <description>Aetherâ€™s team is responsible for running a binary download service. Naming is hard, so their service is simply called DownloadServer. Their service has some guarantees that the binary has not been tampered with, by validating a checksum on the client before any binaries are installed. Aether has a concern that this only mitigates some errors and threat models. If their download servers provide a different binary to some users along with a valid checksum then these clients could install malicious software without detection.</description>
