### Speakers

*Al Cutter*

*Martin Hutchinson*

Martin is a software engineer at Google, primarily working in open source.
He's been developing and maintaining the TrustFabric open source portfolio since 2019, working on everything from CT, Trillian, witnessing, development of specs, and the Claimant Model.
Prior to this chapter in open source, he was an SRE and this still drives a passion to make software secure, scaleable, reliable, and maintainable.
